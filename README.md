The following files have been uploaded through the Python terminal.
Exercise 4. 4.
Encrypt all Excel files and your Word CV using your generated passwords, one for each.
I had several conflicts with various pip packages such as: spire.xls and aspose-cells.
The files are encrypted, but a pop-up window asking for the password does not appear when opening an Excel file. Instead, it only prompts when attempting to update or modify the sheet, requiring manual entry of the password through Excel.
